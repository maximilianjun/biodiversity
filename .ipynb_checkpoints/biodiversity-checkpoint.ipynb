    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to analyse biodiversity data from the National Parks Service. Various species will investigated in different national park locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project will aim to provide answers to the following questions:\n",
    "1. What is the distribution of conservation status for species?\n",
    "2. Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?\n",
    "3. Is there a correlation between species and their conversation status?\n",
    "4. Which animal is the most common and what is their distribution amongst parks?\n"

    "### Project Goals\n",
    "The project goal is to examine biodiversity data  for the National Parks Service. It should provide insight what is expected from a data analyst on a day to day basis and what tools and methodologies to deploy approrpriately. The project aims to understand the relationship between species and their conservation status. The following questions will provide a guide for this project:\n",
    "1. What is the distribution of conservation status for species?\n",
    "2. Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?\n",
    "3. Is there a correlation between species and their conversation status?\n",
    "4. Which animal is the most common and what is their distribution amongst parks?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "The Species_info.csv file contains information about each species. The observations.csv file conatains information on observations of species within the park locations. This data will be examined and aim to provide answers to the project goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "Appropriate descriptive statistics and data visualisation techniques will be used to analyse and understand the data. Inferential statistics will be used as descriptive statistics will not be enough to answer the project goal questions alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation\n",
    "The final section will outline a conclusion. The conclusion will aim to answer the project goal questions including any limitations of the methodologies deployed and if any any improvement could be made. Any further research suggested will be mentioned."
